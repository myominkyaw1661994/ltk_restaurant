### **Expected Behavior:**

**Before Login:**
- Shows "·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äõ·Äî·Ä∫" (Login) button
- No navigation links visible
- No user info visible

**After Login (Admin):**

- Shows navigation links: Products, Sales, Purchases, POS
- Shows "User Management" in dropdown
- Shows logout button

- Does NOT show "User Management" in dropdown
- Shows logout button

### **Key Features:**

1. **Automatic Re-render**: Navbar updates immediately after login/logout
2. **Role-based Navigation**: Different menu items based on user role
3. **Event-driven Updates**: Uses custom events for real-time updates
4. **Storage Event Listening**: Responds to localStorage changes
5. **Pathname Updates**: Re-checks auth state on navigation

### **Technical Implementation:**

- **Event System**: Uses `authStateChanged` custom events
- **Storage Events**: Listens for localStorage changes
- **State Management**: Centralized auth state in auth utility
- **Role-based UI**: Conditional rendering based on user role
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Event listeners properly cleaned up

### **Troubleshooting:**

If Navbar doesn't re-render:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify localStorage has `auth_token` and `auth_user`
3. Check if custom events are being dispatched
4. Verify user role is correct in Firestore
